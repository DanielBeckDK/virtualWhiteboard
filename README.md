# virtualWhiteboard

A project created in conjunction with a job application with CIC-IBM

I chose to go with the Virtual White Board project since it sounded fun and I quickly was inspired as to how it might be done :)
I am not the strongest in CSS but I have chosen to go the full-stack route for this project and I have tried deviding my focus equally between front-end, back-end and database etc.
I have focused on the creation of content on the whiteboard so there's no role management. Users have to be created by an admin with access to the DB and be given their login. Users can create posts and delete their own posts and see what everyone in their team has posted.

Project created with a XAMPP stack
1: Create db named virutal_whiteboard in phpmyadmin
2: Import db file found in repo into this new db
3: Start apache server and go to http://localhost:PORT/FOLDERNAME/index.php
4: Site should work
5: login credentials for users can be found in document userCreds.txt
